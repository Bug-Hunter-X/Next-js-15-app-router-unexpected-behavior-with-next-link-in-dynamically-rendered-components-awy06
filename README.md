# Next.js 15 App Router Issue: next/link in Dynamic Components

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior when using the `next/link` component within a dynamically rendered component in Next.js 15's App Router.  The issue primarily occurs in scenarios involving nested layouts or server components, leading to inconsistent redirects or errors.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of the link in the `pages/index.js` component.

## Potential Causes

The root cause is likely related to the App Router's new rendering model and how it handles dynamic component hydration.  Issues may arise with improper timing of client-side hydration or inconsistencies in the way React reconciles the component tree.

## Proposed Solution (see bugSolution.js)

The solution is to use `useRouter` hook and use the navigate method to redirect the user.
